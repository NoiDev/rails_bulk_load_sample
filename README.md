# Rails Sample Code

This is a bulk-load system extracted from a recent project.

Data was accepted in either CSV or Excel format for loading into the main database.  Data could be validated and loaded if clean or optionally validated only.  Validation and load results were returned to the front-end.

Note: Non-relevant code as well as propriatary model code has been removed.  More detail available upon request.
